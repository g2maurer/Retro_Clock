# Retro_Clock
This is a highly modified version of TechKiwiGadgets clock found on Instructables.

Modifications:
1. Changed TFT display to an SPI version which has a much improved Touch interface.
2. Added SPIFFS to support files for data and images. This freed up memory and added flexability.
3. Added support for optional RTC (real time clock IC). Improves time keeping accuracy.
4. Added support for LDR (light dependent resistor) so that display is dimmed at night.
5. Added audio amplifier (LM386) and volume control via touch screen.
6. Redesigned user interface (Touch menu) to support added features.
7. Made many changes to firmware to improve speed and readability. 
8. Designed PCB to support above mentioned changes.
9. Redesigned 3D printed parts to support hardware changes.
